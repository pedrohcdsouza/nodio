## About the Project  

**Nodio** is similar to tools like [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) and [Astah UML](https://astah.net/): you create diagrams to model systems, visualize workflows, and design architectures.  

But behind the scenes, it is very different: instead of being static files, your diagrams are **versioned**, connected to **Git repositories**, and can **automatically update parts of your codebase**.  

For development teams, this means a diagram is no longer just documentation — it becomes part of the **development workflow**. A change in the diagram can generate or update code, while every version is tracked and synchronized, just like source code.  

It is an easily **self-hostable**, **developer-friendly** alternative to traditional diagramming tools, designed to integrate directly with your existing projects and repositories.  

Each project using **Nodio** can define its own workflow: whether diagrams should generate boilerplate code, update database schemas, or serve as living documentation that evolves alongside the system.

### Why it’s called Nodio  

Inspired by the concept of **nodes**, the building blocks of diagrams, and the idea of connecting them (and your code) into a **living network**.
